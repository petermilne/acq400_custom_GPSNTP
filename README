README for package: custom_gpsntp

Configures ACQ400 as an NTP server conditioned by GPS

#1 GPS NMEA feed on ttyPS2

#2 PPS input

Must be in the device tree at boot, eg
dtb.d/acq1002r.dtb
	pps1 {
		/* TRG.d6 on ptype ... we're not sure which one it will be */
		gpios = <&gpio0 60 0>;
	
		compatible = "pps-gpio";
		status = "disabled";	
	};


dtb.d/acq1002.dtb
Prototype system ..

	pps {
		/* TRG.d3 on ptype */
		gpios = <&gpio0 57 0>;
		
		compatible = "pps-gpio";
		status = "okay";	
	};


#3 Provides own ntp.conf
/usr/local/CARE/GPSNTP/ntp.conf

unless overridden by /mnt/local/ntp.conf

The correct executable is /usr/sbin/ntpd.orig

NB: do NOT use /usr/sbin/ntpd

The init file gives you the opportunity to override the default command using a stored script


#4 TP2 set to 100Hz
# add to /mnt/local/rc.user
gps_reset
sleep 10
/usr/local/bin/ubx_set_tp2
